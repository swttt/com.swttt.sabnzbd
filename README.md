# Sabnzbd

This app adds the ability to control Sabnzbd from Homey
For example you can:

- Pause downloads
- Resume downloads
- Set download speed limit (%)

Together with presence you are able to resume downloads when nobody is at home. Or pause/limit downloads when the TV is turned on.

### Issues & Feature requests

If you found any bugs you can create an issue on [github](https://github.com/swttt/com.swttt.sabnzbd).

Features are limited now, previous versions had polling to check for current downloadspeed etc. This is disabled for now because i want to keep this app as small as possible.

Any other requests can be filed on [github](https://github.com/swttt/com.swttt.sabnzbd) as well.
